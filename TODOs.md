#This document will discribe the open tasks and allocate responsibility

## The main tasks of this project are as follow

- Implement a power function on the GPU to calculate all image moments
- Implement a image update algorithm after a transformation is executed.
- ~~Build GPU implementation using [CPU Levenberg-Marguardt algorithm][1]~~
- ~~Build an image input and output with openCV.~~
- Build an image input and output with libpng (preferred).
- Run algorithm in Parallel for 6 normalized instances of image, each after undergoing a 60 degree rotation.
- ~~(optional) Create a Cmake file for easy compilation.~~
- (optional) Create a Matlab wrapper for ease of use by other researchers.
