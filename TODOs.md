#This document will discribe the open taskes and allocate responsibility

## The main tasks of this project are as follow

- implement a power function on the GPU to calculate all image moments
- implement a image update algorithm after a transformation is executed.
- build GPU implementation using CPU Levenberg-Marguardt algorithm from (cite code)
- Build an image input and output with openCV or libpng (preferred).
- Run algorithm in Parallel for 6 normalized instances of image, each after undergoing a 60 degree rotation.
- (optional) Create a Cmake file for easy compilation.
- (optional) Create a Matlab wrapper for ease of use by other researchers.
